# ldm-tools
A set of tools for managing logical data models created according to the UML profile used for the "ldm" project.

The initial release provides support for creating catalogue documentation in Word (OOXML) and HTML formats. Exports into Excel and potentially Powerpoint and Visio will follow. The project uses the following libraries:
* Eclipse EMF and UML2 libraries to parse the XMI created by Papyrus (an Eclipse plugin for editing UML models)
* Apache POI to create the OOXML documents
* Freemarker to create HTML files
